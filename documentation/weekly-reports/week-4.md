# Week 4

This week I implemented all of the drawing rules, en passant moves and castling. I also started implementing my own datastructures starting with ArrayLists. In addition, I made a Zobrist class that takes care of hashing of chess positions. This will be used more in transposition tables and hashmaps. 

The next job would be to continue implementing custom data structures and starting to use iterative deepening and transposition tables with the search. I was also thinking about making users able to play vs the AI. 

Estimated time used: 8 hours
