# Week 6

This week I am still rewriting some parts of the code so the new stuff is still unfinished. Fortunately I looked at the requirements for the week 6 and I have already implemented my own data structures etc. I will need to finish up with the rewriting (hopefully in time). Nonetheless, I have plans to implement a way to play against the AI before the demo event.
