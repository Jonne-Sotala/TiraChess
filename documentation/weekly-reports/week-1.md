# Week 1

This week I thought about the possible project ideas and ended up going with chess. I used majority of my 
time this week to research how chess AIs are made and what kind of algorithms they use. I used 
[Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) to do my research for the most part. 
I also created the project on GitHub and wrote the requirements specification document. 

Estimated time used: 5 hours
