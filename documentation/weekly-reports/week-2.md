# Week 2

This week I started the project itself. I began building the Board class that will keep track 
of the positions in the chess game. I also used a considerable amount of time to learn about Gradle,
Java Unit Testing and also I had to learn how to implement the test coverage and code checkstyle for
Java. 

Next week, I have to finish the Board class. Especially I need to create the method that gets
all the next possible moves in given board state. After that I will be able to implement the min-max
search algorithm for different board states. 

Estimated time used: 6 hours
