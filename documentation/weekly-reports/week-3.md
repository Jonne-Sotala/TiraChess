# Week 3

This week I mostly finised up with the Board class that keeps track of the positions in a chess game. It took longer than I expected because there are so many different moves different chess pieces make. It is still missing some drawing conditions, castling and en passant. 

Then I started with the min-max algorithm and also implemented a basic version of alphabeta pruning. Currently, you just need to set the depth of the search and it will search up to that depth. The evaluation function used is still quite simple and only takes into account the material differences between players. 

Next week I will implement the remaining chess rules related to drawing the game and castling and en passant. Also I will have to begin implementing my own data structures. Then if I have enough time, I will try to make the evaluation and search more advanced. 

Estimated time used: 10 hours
